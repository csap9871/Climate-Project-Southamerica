# Climate-Project-Southamerica

Physics of the climate system – WS 2016/2017
Final Projects
40% of the final grade
1. Objectives
Write a report and give a short presentation about the climate of a given region/continent. In
groups of three, you will use a global reanalysis dataset to describe the spatio-temporal
features of the regional climate. You will discuss your results in relation to selected literature
and present them in condensed form to the rest of the class.
2. Informal objectives
Learn about the methods and tools used in climate research. Getting familiar with the
specificities of the climate in several regions of the world. Do your own exploratory research
in order to gain insights about the drivers of climate variability at regional and local scales.
3. Regions
Africa
Antarctica & Southern Ocean
Australia & Indonesia & New Zealand
South-America
North-America
South-Asia + neighbors
4. Organisation
Four groups of three students, two groups of two (one group per region)
Please give me your preferences before Monday 05.12.2016 evening (see google-sheet and
e-mail)
Preparation: independent team work + sessions with me (Tuesdays)
Presentations: Tuesday 24.01.2017, 13:30-15:00. Each group: 12 min pres. + 3 min
discussion
Final report submission deadline: 24.01.2017
5. Formal requirements
To pass the exam, the following minimum requirements must be fulfilled:
- final report (a jupyter notebook) submitted in time
- each group member must contribute to the report and presentation, the personal
contributions should be stated in the introduction of the final report
- the notebook should be self-contained and must be structured around well defined sections
/ analyses / plots / descriptions
- scientific rigor: the plots must be as understandable as possible (title, units, x and y axis
labels, appropriate colors and levels...). The text must be clear. Findings or assumptions must
be supported by appropriate references if they are not derived from the figures.
- literature: at least three publications must be cited in the report
- reproducible science: I must be able to run the code and understand it (i.e. if you use new
data or new python packages you must submit it together with your report)
6. Scientific requirements
At minimum, the following analyses must be presented:
- Description of the basic features of climate: temperature, precipitation and surface wind.
Averages, seasonality, description of the regional patterns and description of sub-regions
according to their climate
- Description of the atmospheric drivers of the regional climate: at least one circulation plot
in the lower, mid- and upper troposphere and one atmospheric cross-section.
- Variability: standard deviation and coefficient of variation of temperature and
precipitation. At least one time series of regionally averaged temperature and precipitation.
Name and discuss the drivers of regional variability according to the literature (e.g. ENSO,
NAO, SOI...).
Other possible analyses based on your personal interest or motivation:
- climate anomalies: pick up as specific period (e.g. El Niño 1998, negative NAO winter
2010...) and describe the climate anomalies for that period
- atmospheric circulation anomalies (advanced): same as above but for the atmospheric
circulation (this requires more data – available on demand)
- choose a sub-region (e.g. Sahel Zone in Africa, Altiplano in South America, Peninsula in
Antarctica) or a specific location and describe its climate in more detail
- drivers of variability (advanced): correlation analyses with climate indexes (ENSO, NAO,
SOI)
